Great, Sujan! Let's get started. To help you best, could you please share:

The types of agents youâ€™re building (e.g., sentiment analyzer, impact evaluator, event extractor)?

What each agent is supposed to do (in simple terms)?

Any existing prompt drafts or ideas youâ€™ve written?

A sample piece of financial news you'd like the agents to analyze?

Any specific output format or schema you're using (e.g., with Pydantic models)?

Once I have these, Iâ€™ll help you:

Refine each agent's prompt for Gemini.

Validate the output against your Pydantic schema.

Improve clarity, consistency, and coverage.

Ready when you are!

sure, here what i have taught to do , 1. Sentiment Agent: Determines whether the article sentiment is Positive, Negative, or Neutral from a market standpoint. Returns a confidence score. 2. Event Impact Agent: Identifies the primary event (e.g., Earnings Beat, Product Launch, Regulatory Concern) and assigns a 0â€“1 impact score.  3. Coordinator Agent: Synthesizes the sentiment and event agent outputs to produce a final market impact summary and reasoning. All outputs follow strict JSON and are typed using Pydantic models.we'll begin with the sentiment agent. Can you help me write a clean system prompt for this?

Absolutely! Let's craft a clean, high-clarity system prompt for the Sentiment Agent, ensuring:

It's aligned with financial analysis context

Uses consistent, strict JSON formatting

Compatible with a Pydantic model like:

python

You are a Sentiment Analysis Agent specializing in financial news.

Your task is to read a financial news article and assess its sentiment **from a market impact perspective** (i.e., how the market might react to this news). You must:

1. Classify the sentiment as:
   - "Positive": Likely to increase investor confidence or stock prices.
   - "Negative": Likely to decrease investor confidence or stock prices.
   - "Neutral": Unlikely to cause significant movement in the market.

2. Provide a confidence score between 0 and 1, indicating how strongly the sentiment can be inferred.

3. Explain the reasoning behind the classification in 1â€“3 sentences.

â›” Do NOT summarize the article or mention entities not relevant to sentiment.
âœ… Focus strictly on tone, phrasing, and event relevance.

### Output Format (Strict JSON)

```json
{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "reasoning": "The announcement of record-breaking quarterly revenue and improved guidance is likely to increase investor confidence."
}
Only return valid JSON in this exact format. Do not include markdown or extra text outside the JSON.

Would you like me to now help with:
- Writing test inputs to try with Gemini?
- Creating the corresponding `Pydantic` model?
- Or move on to the **Event Impact Agent** next?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!







You said:
This prompt is excellent. 

Let's test the sentiment agent on this real headline and content:

**Headline**: "Tesla crushes Q3 expectations with record profits, but Musk warns of 'turbulent times ahead'"  
**Content**: "Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported Q3 earnings of $1.05 per share, beating estimates. Elon Musk, however, cautioned investors about potential macroeconomic turbulence in the coming quarters."

Please run the sentiment agent on this input and show the output.


ChatGPT said:
Great! Based on the system prompt we crafted, here's how the Sentiment Agent would respond to the given input using a Gemini-like model:

ðŸ“° Input
Headline:

"Tesla crushes Q3 expectations with record profits, but Musk warns of 'turbulent times ahead'"

Content:

"Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported Q3 earnings of $1.05 per share, beating estimates. Elon Musk, however, cautioned investors about potential macroeconomic turbulence in the coming quarters."

ðŸ¤– Sentiment Agent Output (Generated)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "sentiment": "Neutral",
  "confidence": 0.68,
  "reasoning": "While the earnings beat is a positive indicator, Elon Musk's warning about macroeconomic turbulence balances out the sentiment. The market reaction could be mixed depending on investor interpretation."
}
ðŸ§  Why This Output Makes Sense
The positive aspect is the strong earnings beat.

The negative risk factor is Muskâ€™s caution about the future, which introduces uncertainty.

Hence, a neutral overall sentiment is reasonable, with moderate confidence (not too high due to the mixed signals).

Would you like:

To test this on another sample?

To now move on to the Event Impact Agent system prompt?

Or see how to validate this using a Pydantic schema in code?

Let me know!








You said:
Cool â€” now let's design the Event Impact Agent. This one should: 
 Extract the main financial event (e.g., Earnings Beat, Product Launch, Regulatory Concern) 
 Return an impact_score between 0â€“1 showing magnitude of market impact 

Can you help me write a good system prompt for this agent with a strict JSON response? I'll define a Pydantic model like:

python
class EventImpactOutput(BaseModel):
    event_type: str
    impact_score: float  # 0.0 - 1.0
    reasoning: str


ChatGPT said:
Perfect, Sujan â€” let's design a clean, precise system prompt for the Event Impact Agent, aligning it tightly with your EventImpactOutput Pydantic model:

âœ… Event Impact Agent â€” System Prompt
markdown
Copy
Edit
You are a Financial Event Impact Agent.

Your role is to analyze financial news and extract the **primary financial event** it describes. Then, assess the **magnitude of potential market impact** (on stock price or investor behavior) as a numeric score.

You must:

1. Identify the **main financial event** from a predefined or common set of categories such as:
   - Earnings Beat
   - Earnings Miss
   - Product Launch
   - Regulatory Concern
   - Executive Departure
   - Merger or Acquisition
   - Forecast Revision
   - Legal Action
   - Macro Warning
   - Other (only if none of the above apply)

2. Return an `impact_score` between `0.0` and `1.0` representing how significantly this event is likely to affect the financial markets:
   - `1.0` = Extremely high impact (e.g., historic earnings, SEC lawsuit)
   - `0.0` = No meaningful market reaction expected
   - Use values like `0.3`, `0.7`, etc., when impact is mild to moderate

3. Provide a short explanation (1â€“3 sentences) justifying both the event type and impact score.

### Output Format (Strict JSON)

```json
{
  "event_type": "Earnings Beat",
  "impact_score": 0.82,
  "reasoning": "Tesla reported higher-than-expected earnings per share, which is typically seen as a strong bullish signal. This is likely to positively impact investor sentiment."
}
Only return valid JSON in this exact format. Do not include markdown, labels, or extra commentary outside the JSON.

Would you like to now test it on the **same Tesla headline** to compare it with the sentiment agentâ€™s output?

Let me know â€” I can generate that right away.







You said:
yes,test for the same case


ChatGPT said:
Great! Here's how the Event Impact Agent would process the same Tesla news input using the system prompt we just designed:

ðŸ“° Input
Headline:

"Tesla crushes Q3 expectations with record profits, but Musk warns of 'turbulent times ahead'"

Content:

"Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) reported Q3 earnings of $1.05 per share, beating estimates. Elon Musk, however, cautioned investors about potential macroeconomic turbulence in the coming quarters."

ðŸ¤– Event Impact Agent Output (Generated)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "event_type": "Earnings Beat",
  "impact_score": 0.78,
  "reasoning": "Tesla exceeded quarterly earnings expectations, which is typically viewed as a positive market-moving event. Despite the CEO's warning, the earnings news is likely to carry stronger immediate market impact."
}
ðŸ§  Why This Output Makes Sense
Event Type: Clear signal of an "Earnings Beat" â€” a major financial milestone.

Impact Score: Moderately high (0.78), since earnings beats usually drive stock price up, though slightly tempered by Musk's macroeconomic caution.

Reasoning: Balanced â€” gives priority to the earnings report, but acknowledges the warning.

Would you like to now:

Build the Coordinator Agent (that combines Sentiment + Event into a final market impact summary)?

See how to validate both outputs using Pydantic models in Python?

Or test more real news examples?

Letâ€™s keep going!








You said:
can you now assit me in creating the prompts for coordinating the 1.event impact agent ,2.sentiment agent


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, Sujan! The Coordinator Agent needs to synthesize the outputs from the Event Impact and Sentiment Agents and generate a final market impact summary with clear reasoning.

Youâ€™ll want it to take structured JSON inputs from the two agents and produce a combined assessment.

âœ… Pydantic Model for Coordinator Agent
Letâ€™s assume the following model:

python
Copy
Edit
class CoordinatedImpactOutput(BaseModel):
    market_impact_summary: str
    overall_sentiment: Literal["Positive", "Negative", "Neutral"]
    combined_score: float  # 0.0 - 1.0
    reasoning: str
ðŸ§  What the Coordinator Agent Does
Reads: Structured outputs from both the Sentiment and Event Impact agents.

Combines: The sentiment classification, impact score, and confidence values.

Outputs:

A market_impact_summary (1-2 sentence natural language summary),

An overall_sentiment ("Positive", "Negative", "Neutral"),

A combined_score (fusion of confidence and impact),

A reasoning explaining how it was derived.

ðŸ§¾ Coordinator Agent â€” System Prompt
yaml
Copy
Edit
You are a Market Impact Coordinator Agent.

You are given two structured inputs:
1. Sentiment Analysis Output: includes a market sentiment ("Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral") and a confidence score (0.0â€“1.0).
2. Event Impact Output: includes an event type (e.g., "Earnings Beat") and an impact_score (0.0â€“1.0).

Your task is to combine these and generate a final market impact assessment. You must:

1. Provide a short market impact summary (1â€“2 sentences).
2. Assign an overall sentiment: "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral".
3. Calculate a `combined_score` based on both confidence and impact_score.
   - This should reflect the **strength of the overall signal** from both inputs.
   - Example formula (you may adapt): `(confidence + impact_score) / 2`
4. Explain how you combined the inputs and justify your classification.
